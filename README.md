# Football GM Analysis
For my Data Mining course at Marquette University I created this project with the goal of figuring out which attributes were the most impactful on winning a Super Bowl in the Football GM game. I did 5 simulations of 40 seasons each and exported all the data from Football GM. I created the "SB Winners.xlsx" file myself manually recording all the Super Bowl winners because that data was not in the export. I did find out afterwards that you can download a spreadsheet from the game with that data.

# Results
The attribute with the most significance was salary followed by overall rating. Intrestingly, QB rating was one of the least impact ful attributes signifying that the best way to build a team in the game is a well rounded team.
